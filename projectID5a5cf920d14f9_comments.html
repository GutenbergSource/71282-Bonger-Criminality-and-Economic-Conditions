<HTML><BODY>This standard work on the relation between criminality and economic conditions was reprinted as late as 1967. It is derived from the Ph.D. thesis of the Dutch criminologist and sociologist, Willem Adriaan Bonger, originally written in French (in 1905), for which he earned a cum laude graduation. This book documents in great detail (with many tables and diagrams) how poverty and abhorrent social conditions correlate strongly with high levels of crime. 

<p>Bonger was a Social-Democrat, active in the Dutch pre-war political party SDAP (Social-Democratic Labourer's Party, one of the predecessors of the current Dutch Labor Party); he detested fascism so deeply that when the Nazi criminals took over the Netherlands, he committed suicide together with his wife on the 15th of May 1940, leaving a note: "I see no future for me anymore, and I will not bend for the scum that will rule now." He was one of almost 400 who committed suicide that month, six times the average of preceding years.
